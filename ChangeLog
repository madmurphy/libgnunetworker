Change Log
==========


## 0.4.1 (2022-02-07)

Changes:

* Minor code review
* Documentation
* Examples


## 0.4.0 (2022-02-01)

Changes:

* Identifier † `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_OK` in `enum GNUNET_WORKER_ErrNo` has been
  renamed to `GNUNET_WORKER_SUCCESS`
* The behavior of all functions has been rendered as agnostic as possible in
  respect to which thread invokes them
* Conditional branching has been made more coherent, although this has come
  with a cost in the length and the complexity of the code
* General code review
* Documentation


## 0.3.1 (2022-01-29)

Changes:

* Code review in the implementation (a possible memory leak before worker
  destruction has been prevented; the `O_NONBLOCK` flag has been assigned to
  the worker's file descriptor; unnecessary calls to `pthread_cond_signal()`
  have been removed from `requirement.h`; general code review)
* Documentation


## 0.3.0 (2022-01-27)

Changes:

* The interface has changed in respect to worker creation. All the three
  functions `GNUNET_WORKER_create()`, `GNUNET_WORKER_start_serving()`,
  `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()` now return error codes, while the
  handle for the allocated worker is passed via placeholder argument. **This
  breaks binary compatibility with previous versions**. Using error codes has
  allowed to remove several log messages, which now will be up to the user.
* Support for a `master_routine` argument has been added to
  `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()` (again, binary compatibility break)
* The † `GNUNET_WorkerHandlerRoutine` data type has been renamed to
  `GNUNET_WORKER_MasterRoutine`
* A new `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOT_ALONE` error code can now be returned by
  `GNUNET_WORKER_synch_destroy()` and `GNUNET_WORKER_timedsynch_destroy()`
* The role of the `on_worker_end` routine has been defined more strictly
* General code review in the implementation
* Documentation
* Examples


## 0.2.0 (2022-01-26)

Changes:

* Identifier † `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_NOTIFICATION` in `enum GNUNET_WORKER_ErrNo`
  has been renamed to `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_SIGNAL`
* A missing check has been added to `GNUNET_WORKER_adopt_running_scheduler()`
* Owned threads have been ensured to result in either joined or detached after
  calling `GNUNET_WORKER_asynch_destroy()`, `GNUNET_WORKER_synch_destroy()`,
  `GNUNET_WORKER_timedsynch_destroy()` or `GNUNET_WORKER_dismiss()`
* `GNUNET_WORKER_ERR_SIGNAL` has been added to the possible return values of
  `GNUNET_WORKER_start_serving()`
* Stack usage during worker creation has been drastically reduced
* Log messages and source code have been made more expressive
* The `Requirement` data type and its methods have been moved to a separate
  private header (`src/requirement.h`)
* The public header has been moved to the `include` subdirectory
* General package review
* Documentation
* Examples


## 0.1.0 (2022-01-24)
